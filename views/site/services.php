  				<h2>Maintenance</h2>
  				<p>A comprehensive maintenance package can be added to your leasing contract for an additional fixed monthly cost. This will cover the cost of all servicing, brakes, replacement tyres, even punctures. A maintenance package is a popular choice as it gives you peace of mind that any repairs can be easily arranged and the costs are all covered within your maintenance fee with no unexpected surprises. Read on for more information or ask your account manager for further details.

  <h2>GAP Insurance</h2>
  <p>Brand-new vehicles can lose up to 50% of their value in the first three years. If your vehicle is in an accident and written off, you will only receive a pay-out from the insurance company for what the vehicle is worth at that time. As a result, you may find your settlement doesn't completely pay off the outstanding finance owed on your vehicle which will leave you with the balance to pay on a vehicle that you no longer have. </p>

  <p>Gap insurance will pay the difference between the motor insurer settlement and the outstanding finance on your vehicle.</p>
